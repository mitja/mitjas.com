Citations from the first edition:

"When we look toward what is known about the nature of interaction, why not turn to those who manage it best - to those of the world of drama, of the stage, of the theatre?" (Donald A. Norman, p. xii)

"agent to mean one who initiates action, a definition consistent with Aristotle's use of the concept Poetics.

in general, psychology attemts to describe what goes on in the real world with all its fuzziness and loose ends, while theatre attempts to represent something that might go on, simplified for the purpose of logical and affective clarity.

critique: not support action that integrates human agency but leaves the design to the author.

experience of interactivity is a "thresholdy" phenommen. real issue: How can people participate as agents within representational contexts?

overlap: representing action with multiple agents.

much of what we see in TV or streaming or so me, is trivial content, impoverished range of points of view, diminish the human nature by diminishing what we think about and how we think about it.

the four causes, or why things are the way they are:

- formal cause: the form or shape of what it is trying to be
- material cause: what is it made of; properties of material influence the properties of the thing
- efficient cause: the way in which it is actually made.
- end cause: its purpose, what is it intended to do in the world once it is completed?

applied to theatre:

- formal cause: completed plot, the whole action the playwright is trying to represent
- material cause: the stuff a play is made of, the enactment is the performance, that which enfolds before the eyes and ears of the audience; there is more to enactment than words - the experience
- efficient cause: the skills, tools, techniques of the playwrights, actors, and other actors who contribute to the finished play
- end cause: the pleasurable arousal and expression of a particular set of emotions in the audience (cathasis)

formal cause: inherently stochastic, not deterministic, a world on its own; formal cause is fragile; new forms of interaction - conversational that are a joy to use, a much improved genre, autonomous agents, a new genre? not completely

material cause: all things digital, code, pixels, waveforms, a model and the way it's prompted (directed) is a part of it. our participation can be more open-ended, we experience it and we experience our actions with it. cannot change fundamentally, in the end we are still human.

efficient cause: code, dev skills, data skills, all other kinds of skills, new skills, system capabilities already part - ever, in theatre, in comp games, models are just a new kind of skill or capability.

end cause: also both (arousal or xxx), the purpose. can be directed

Aristotle's model it is still applicable...



the six qualitative elements and causal relations among them:

Action

Character

Thought

"In his application of a theatrical analogy to the domain of artificial intelligence, Julian Hilton puts it this way: 'What the audience does is supply the inferencing engine which drives the plot, obeying Shakespeare's injunction to eke out the imperfections of the play (its incompleteness) with its mind. (Hilton, 1991)

p 57.

"Can computers think? There is an easy answer: Computer-based agents, like dramatic characters, do not have to *think* (in fact there are many ways in which the cannot); the simply have to *provide a representation from which thought may be inferred*."

true, it feels very much like it, I ...


2023 is 30 aniversary of the book. it is also the breaktrhough year of approachable AI, Generative AI, curious what we will see on its 40th or 50th aniversary. whatever this may be, if it's *for us*, the basic premises of Computers as Theatre will still hold.

Language, usually translated as diction

the expression of their (the caracters') thought in words

- much closer to original (drama the use of language, classic hci: selection and arrangement of signs, semiotically used symbolic representations) - it is a language but not a spoken human language. now the machine can speak, too.

Melody (Pattern) - the pleasurable perception of pattern in sensory phenomena.

Spectacle (Enactment) - sensory dimensions, orthodox view: spectacle is visible melody audible, but this is 


... the Greeks employed drama as tools for thought.


nothing new under the sun, since 400-500 BC?
Yes and no. We are still the same, but we have created ourselfs vastly different tools. The newness might distract from applying the basic, long-known and long proven principles. We can build on this, and we do good by looking at what we can learn from theatre, and drama.

I find this as striking now, if not even more so, as when I read this the first time when I was at University of Arts, studying communication design.

the qualitative elements are even closer to drama, than before, with llms playing characters.

As then, it is a treasure trove of inspiration. There are many untreaded roads, like melody (pattern)



Brenda Laurel's Computers as Theatre revolutionized the field of human-computer interaction, offering ideas that inspired generations of interface and interaction designers-and continue to inspire them. Laurel's insight was that effective interface design, like effective drama, must engage the user directly in an experience involving both thought and emotion. Her practical conclusion was that a user's enjoyment must be a paramount design consideration, and this demands a deep awareness of dramatic theory and technique, both ancient and modern.

Now, two decades later, Laurel has revised and revamped her influential work, reflecting back on enormous change and personal experience and forward toward emerging technologies and ideas that will transform human-computer interaction yet again. Beginning with a clear analysis of classical drama theory, Laurel explores new territory through the lens of dramatic structure and purpose.Computers as Theatre, Second Edition,is directed to a far wider audience, is written more simply and elegantly, is packed with new examples, and is replete with exciting and important new ideas.
