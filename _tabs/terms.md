## General Terms of Digistore24 and Additional Terms​

By purchasing a course, you agree to terms by Digistore24. Digistore24 is my merchant and contractual partner. By sending the order you acknowledge the Terms and Conditions as well as the Privacy Policy of Digistore24 as part of a closed sales contract and acknowledge that you understand the revocation right for consumers.
​
In addition of the Terms and Conditions of Digistore24, the following Terms and Conditions are added by Mitja Martini ("I") and You (“Client”, “Student” or “You”) agree to the following terms stated herein.

## Refund Policy​

I provide a 60-day money-back guarantee for each purchase of a premium course. That money-back guarantee is governed by the following terms.

I want you to be satisfied with your purchase, ​but I also need to protect myself from refund abuse. Thus, I reserve the right to, in my sole discretion, limit or deny refund requests in cases where I believe there is refund abuse, including but not limited to the following: A significant portion of the video lectures have been consumed or downloaded by You before the refund was requested.

In the event that you decide your purchase was not the right decision and you did not consume a significant portion of the video content and are within 60 days of purchase contact me at hi@mitjamartini.com and let me know you would like a refund.

I will not provide refunds after more than 60 days following the date of purchase. After day 60, all payments are non-refundable and you are responsible for full payment of the fees regardless if you complete the course.

Upon determining that you are entitled to a refund pursuant to this policy, I will promptly instruct Digistore24 or my payment processor to issue the refund. I do not control Digistore24 nor my payment processor and will not be able to expedite any refunds.
